cell Latin cella meaning room basic structural functional biological unit living organisms cell smallest unit life replicate independently cells often building blocks life cells cell biology  Cells cytoplasm enclosed within membrane contains biomolecules proteins nucleic acids Organisms classified unicellular consisting cell including bacteria multicellular including plants animals number cells plants animals varies species species humans contain 10 trillion 1013 cells plant animal cells visible microscope dimensions 1 100 micrometres  cell discovered Robert Hooke 1665 named biological unit resemblance cells inhabited Christian monks monastery Cell theory developed 1839 Matthias Jakob Schleiden Theodor Schwann states organisms composed cells cells fundamental unit structure function living organisms cells come preexisting cells cells contain hereditary information necessary regulating cell functions transmitting information generation cells Cells emerged Earth 3 5 billion years ago Prokaryotic cells life Earth characterised vital biological processes including cell signaling self-sustaining simpler smaller eukaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles nucleus Prokaryotes
