cloning raised controversies ethical concerns prompted several nations pass laws regarding human cloning legality commonly discussed theoretical human cloning therapeutic cloning reproductive cloning Therapeutic cloning cloning cells human use medicine transplants active area research medical practice anywhere world July 2016 common methods therapeutic cloning researched somatic-cell nuclear transfer recently pluripotent stem cell induction Reproductive cloning making entire cloned human instead cells tissues Although possibility cloning humans subject speculation 20th century scientists policy makers began prospect seriously mid-1960s Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Joshua Lederberg advocated cloning genetic engineering article American Naturalist 1966 following year Washington Post [1] sparked debate conservative bioethicist Leon Kass wrote time programmed reproduction man fact dehumanize Nobel Laureate James D Watson publicized potential perils cloning Atlantic Monthly essay Moving Toward Clonal Man 1971 [2] cloning sheep Dolly 1996 somatic cell nuclear transfer SCNT idea human cloning became hot debate topic [3] nations outlawed scientists promised clone within years hybrid human clone created November 1998 Advanced Cell Technology created using SCNT - nucleus taken man's leg cell inserted cow's egg nucleus removed hybrid cell cultured developed embryo embryo destroyed 12 days [4] 2004 2005 Hwang Woo-suk professor Seoul National University published separate articles journal Science claiming successfully harvested pluripotent embryonic stem cells cloned human blastocyst using somatic-cell nuclear transfer techniques Hwang claimed created eleven different patent-specific stem cell lines breakthrough human cloning [5] 2006 Science retracted articles clear evidence data experiments fabricated [6] January 2008 Dr Andrew French Samuel Wood biotechnology company Stemagen announced successfully created mature human embryos using SCNT case embryo created taking nucleus skin cell donated Wood colleague inserting human egg nucleus removed embryos developed blastocyst stage point processes destroyed Members lab set experiments aim generate embryonic stem cell lines holy grail useful therapeutic reproductive cloning [7][8] 2011 scientists New York Stem Cell Foundation announced succeeded generating embryonic stem cell lines process leaving oocyte's nucleus place resulting triploid cells useful cloning [9][10][11] 2013 group scientists led Shoukhrat Mitalipov published report embryonic stem cells created using SCNT experiment researchers developed protocol using SCNT human cells differs slightly organisms embryonic stem cell lines human fetal somatic cells derived blastocysts lines derived using oocytes donor ensuring mitochondrial DNA inherited identical [9] year later team led Robert Lanza Advanced Cell Technology reported replicated Mitalipov's results demonstrated effectiveness cloning adult cells using SCNT somatic cell nuclear transfer SCNT nucleus somatic cell taken donor transplanted host egg cell genetic material removed previously making enucleated egg donor somatic cell genetic material transferred

History article [3] Creating induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs inefficient process Pluripotency refers stem cell potential differentiate germ layers endoderm interior stomach lining

mature cell cause cell become pluripotent stem cell process highly new techniques discovered frequently better induction process Depending method reprogramming adult cells iPSCs implantation severe limitations humans virus reprogramming factor cell cancer-causing genes oncogenes activated cells appear rapidly dividing cancer cells respond body's natural cell signaling process 2008 scientists discovered technique remove presence oncogenes pluripotency induction thereby increasing potential use iPSC humans Comparing SCNT Reprogramming processes SCNT iPSCs benefits deficiencies Historically reprogramming methods better SCNT derived embryonic stem cells ESCs [9] recent emphasis developing new procedures SCNT-ESCs advantage SCNT iPSCs time speed cells produced iPSCs derivation takes several months SCNT shorter time important medical applications New working improve process iPSC speed efficiency discovery new reprogramming factors oocytes [citation needed] advantage SCNT iPSCs potential treat mitochondrial disease utilizes donor oocyte [9] advantages time using stem cells derived method stem cells derived Work cloning techniques advanced basic understanding developmental biology humans Observing human pluripotent stem cells grown culture provides great insight human embryo development otherwise Scientists able better define steps early human development Studying signal transduction along genetic manipulation within early human embryo potential provide answers developmental diseases defects human-specific signaling pathways discovered studying human embryonic stem cells Studying developmental pathways humans given developmental biologists evidence toward hypothesis developmental pathways conserved throughout species [17] iPSCs cells created SCNT useful research causes disease model systems drug discovery [18][19] Cells produced SCNT iPSCs eventually stem cell therapy [20] create organs transplantation regenerative medicine Stem cell therapy use stem cells treat prevent disease condition Bone marrow transplantation widely stem cell therapy [21] forms stem cell therapy clinical use time Research underway potentially use stem cell therapy treat heart disease diabetes spinal cord injuries [22][23] Regenerative medicine clinical practice heavily researched potential uses medicine autologous transplantation thus removing risk organ transplant rejection recipient [24] instance person liver disease potentially new liver grown using genetic material transplanted remove damaged liver [25] current research human pluripotent stem cells promised reliable source generating human neurons showing potential regenerative medicine brain neural injuries bioethics ethics cloning refers variety ethical positions regarding practice possibilities cloning especially human cloning views religious origin questions raised cloning faced secular perspectives Human therapeutic reproductive cloning commercially animals currently cloned laboratories livestock production Advocates support development therapeutic cloning order generate tissues whole organs treat patients otherwise obtain transplants [27] avoid need immunosuppressive drugs [28] stave effects aging [29] Advocates reproductive cloning believe parents otherwise procreate access technology [30] Opposition therapeutic cloning mainly centers status embryonic stem cells connections abortion debate [31] opponents reproductive cloning concerns technology yet developed enough safe - example position American Association Advancement Science 2014 [32] others emphasize reproductive cloning prone abuse leading generation humans whose organs tissues harvested [33][34] concerns cloned individuals integrate families society [35][36] Religious groups divided some[which ] opposing technology usurping God's monotheistic traditions place extent embryos destroying human life others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits
